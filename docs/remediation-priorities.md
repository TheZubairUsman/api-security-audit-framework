- Customer data: 4
- Internal systems: 3
- Development/testing: 2
- Public information: 1

**Difficulty (1-5 scale):**
- Simple configuration: 1
- Code changes required: 3
- Architecture changes: 5

### Decision Tree Example
```
Is vulnerability actively exploited?
‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Critical Priority
‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Continue assessment
    ‚îÇ
    Does it expose sensitive data?
    ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí High Priority
    ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Continue assessment
        ‚îÇ
        Could it cause service disruption?
        ‚îú‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Medium Priority
        ‚îî‚îÄ No ‚Üí Low Priority
```

**Detection and Response:**
```sql
-- Check for recent suspicious database activity
SELECT 
    query_text, 
    execution_time, 
    user_name, 
    client_ip 
FROM query_log 
WHERE query_text LIKE '%UNION%' 
   OR query_text LIKE '%DROP%'
   OR query_text LIKE '%INSERT%'
ORDER BY execution_time DESC;
```

**Immediate Actions:**
- [ ] **Enable query logging** if not already active

- Payment card information
- Health records (PHI)
- Authentication credentials
- API keys and secrets

**Assessment Process:**
```bash
# Audit API responses for sensitive data
curl https://api.example.com/users | jq '.[] | {id, name, ssn, password_hash}'

# Check for debug information leakage
curl https://api.example.com/error-endpoint -v

# Test for information disclosure in error messages
curl https://api.example.com/users/999999999
```

**Remediation Steps:**
1. **Implement response filtering** to remove sensitive fields
2. **Add data classification tags** to all API responses
3. **Review and minimize** data returned by each endpoint
4. **Implement field-level encryption** for sensitive data
5. **Add data loss prevention** monitoring

### Business Logic Vulnerabilities
**Risk**: Financial loss, workflow bypass, operational disruption

# Negative price exploitation
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/orders \
  -d '{"product_id": 1, "quantity": -1, "price": -100}'

# Currency conversion bypass
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/purchase \
  -d '{"amount": 0.01, "currency": "JPY", "convert_to": "USD"}'
```

#### Workflow Bypass
```bash
# Skip payment step
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/orders/123/ship
# Should require payment confirmation first

# Bulk operation abuse  
curl -X DELETE https://api.example.com/users/bulk \
  -d '{"user_ids": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]}'
```

**Remediation Approach:**
1. **Map complete workflows** and identify decision points
2. **Implement state validation** at each workflow step
3. **Add business rule validation** in API layer
4. **Create workflow test cases** for automated testing
5. **Monitor business metrics** for anomalies

### Authorization Bypass
**Risk**: Unauthorized data access, privacy violations

**Testing Methodology:**
```bash
# Test horizontal privilege escalation
USER1_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
USER2_ID="user456"

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER1_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/users/$USER2_ID/profile

# Test vertical privilege escalation
REGULAR_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $REGULAR_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/admin/users

# Test direct object reference
curl https://api.example.com/documents/1
curl https://api.example.com/documents/999999
```

**Fix Implementation:**
1. **Implement proper authorization checks** at resource level
2. **Use resource-based access control** (RBAC)
3. **Validate resource ownership** before operations
4. **Add authorization middleware** to all protected routes
5. **Implement deny-by-default** access policies

### Insufficient Rate Limiting
**Risk**: DoS attacks, resource exhaustion, service degradation

**Rate Limiting Strategy:**
```python
# Implementation example
rate_limits = {
    'public_endpoints': 100,    # requests per minute
    'authenticated': 1000,      # requests per minute
    'admin_operations': 50,     # requests per minute
    'sensitive_data': 10        # requests per minute
}

# Implement sliding window rate limiting
# Add distributed rate limiting for multiple servers
# Include burst protection for sudden traffic spikes
```

## üü° Medium Priority (Fix Within 30 Days)

### Input Validation Weaknesses
**Risk**: Data corruption, injection attacks, system instability

**Comprehensive Input Validation Framework:**
```javascript
// API input validation schema
const userSchema = {
  name: {
    type: 'string',
    minLength: 1,
    maxLength: 100,
    pattern: '^[a-zA-Z\\s]+$'
  },
  email: {
    type: 'string',
    format: 'email',
    maxLength: 255
  },
  age: {
    type: 'integer',
    minimum: 13,
    maximum: 120
  }
};

// Implement centralized validation middleware
function validateInput(schema) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    const result = validate(req.body, schema);
    if (!result.valid) {
      return res.status(400).json({
        error: 'Invalid input',
        details: result.errors
      });
    }
    next();
  };
}
```

**Validation Categories:**
- [ ] **Data Type Validation**: Ensure correct data types

- [ ] **Format Validation**: Validate emails, URLs, dates
- [ ] **Business Rule Validation**: Apply domain-specific rules
- [ ] **Encoding Validation**: Handle special characters properly

### Session Management Issues
**Risk**: Session hijacking, unauthorized access persistence

**Secure Session Implementation:**
```javascript
// Secure session configuration
const sessionConfig = {
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  name: 'sessionId',
  cookie: {
    secure: true,        // HTTPS only
    httpOnly: true,      // Prevent XSS
    maxAge: 900000,      // 15 minutes
    sameSite: 'strict'   // CSRF protection
  },
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  rolling: true          // Reset expiry on activity
};

// Implement session invalidation
function invalidateSession(userId) {
  // Remove from active sessions store
  // Blacklist current tokens
  // Force re-authentication
}
```

### Information Disclosure
**Risk**: Intelligence gathering, attack surface expansion

- [ ] **Implement generic error messages**
- [ ] **Sanitize stack traces** in production
- [ ] **Review API documentation** for over-disclosure
- [ ] **Audit logging output** for sensitive information

### Weak Cryptographic Implementation
**Risk**: Data compromise, authentication bypass

**Cryptographic Standards:**
```javascript
// Strong encryption implementation
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Use strong algorithms
const algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm';
const keyLength = 32;
const ivLength = 16;

// Proper key derivation
function deriveKey(password, salt) {
  return crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, salt, 100000, keyLength, 'sha256');
}

// Secure random generation
function generateSecureToken() {
  return crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
}
```

**Requirements:**
- [ ] **Use approved algorithms** (AES-256, RSA-2048+, SHA-256+)
- [ ] **Implement proper key management**
- [ ] **Use cryptographically secure random numbers**
- [ ] **Apply salting and hashing** for passwords
- [ ] **Validate certificate chains** properly
